Implementing Digital Clock in Cyclone - II FPGA with the use of Seven Segment Display

Digital Clock was implemented in VHDL and was successfully run in the Cyclone 2 FPGA. 
The Seconds and Minutes of the Digital Clock were shown through the 4 â€“ seven segment displays on the FPGA. 
Outputs were verified accordingly.

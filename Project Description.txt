Description for Digital Clock using FPGA :~

This project is about implementation of a digital clock which makes use of Cyclone - 2 FPGA. 
As soon as the FPGA is switched on, the clock starts functioning. 
The FPGA on the board the onboard clock helps in generating timing signals.
For this, 1 second of a regular clock corresponds to 2 picoseconds of the on board clock. 
This means that each rising edge of the on board clock triggers the increment of seconds by 1 second.
This process follows up to 59 seconds and then after that seconds become ‘0’ and minutes ‘1’ and so on.
The code is written in such a way that the minute will increment by one only when the seconds go beyond the value ‘59’ respectively.
If reset condition is ‘0’, then the clock will reset and display “0000” on the seven segment display built into the cyclone 2. 
If reset becomes ‘1’ then the clock process will begin again.
